### Guide
```
○ The script will continuously search for the server "Gyakusatsu" and once found, it will load the autofarm UI and enable farming.

○ You can select your desired stage and skills.

○ By default, no webhook is stored, so you will need to input your own in the settings section.

○ To change the wallpaper, navigate to the "workspace" folder of your executor and find the "Exulus" folder, then the "Wallpaper Folder" and place your desired image there.

○ Reference the image in the settings section of the UI.

○ An example of how to change the wallpaper would be to locate the image file "Exulus.png" and input the exact file name into the designated textbox within the user interface.
```

> **Note**\
> Your webhook will be automatically saved so no need to re-entering it.\
> Your wallpaper will be automatically saved so no need to re-entering it.\
> Your selected stage and skills will be saved so no need for toggling them over and over again.
